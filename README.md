Article Name: Q-star (Q\*): What it is and what it could mean for the future of AI

Article Link: https://www.superannotate.com/blog/q-star-overview

This article examines the stages of AI development as well as the future of this technology. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is explained to be the final stage of AI,
where machines have the ability to replicate the thought processes of a human. Though this is the case, there are still major roadblocks, as logical problem-solving skills
are still relatively hard to achieve on current models.

Q* (Q-star) got its name from A* Search and Q Learning. A* is a distance-based learning technique where models are trained to find the most efficient path from point A to B;
while Q Learning is a machine learning method to form the best decisions given a problem. By combining both techniques, Q* is able to achieve logic and reasoning abilities relative
to its counterparts. Currently, Q\* can solve basic math problems. Though this may seem insignificant, it is a huge step towards achieving AGI, as the foundations of logical
reasoning and decision-making are being set.

Super interesting article. As you mentoined, right now there are major road blocks; however, I wonder what the landscape will look like in a few years with more resources and time dedicated. With the advancements of algorithms such as Q\*, it is only a matter of time before there are AIs featuring AGI.
